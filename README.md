AI-Powered-Data-Analyst



1. Introduction

The AI employee prototype is a comprehensive system designed to handle data processing, analysis, report generation, and user interaction. The system is modular, with four main components: Data Processing, Analysis Engine, Report Generation, and User Interaction. Each module is implemented with specific goals to provide a robust and functional tool for data analysis.








2. Approach
   
2.1 Data Processing
Objective: Implement a data ingestion module that can handle various file formats and create a data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline.

Approach:

Data Ingestion:

The DataProcessor class is responsible for reading data from various file formats such as CSV, JSON, Excel, and others. The read_file method identifies the file type based on its extension and loads the data accordingly.
For less common formats, additional methods (read_avro, read_yaml, read_sqlite, read_msg) handle specific file types.
Data Cleaning:

The clean_data method removes rows with missing values to ensure the integrity of the dataset.
The drop_unnecessary_columns method dynamically drops columns based on a predefined list of likely unnecessary columns, although further improvements could involve dynamic column selection based on content or metadata.




2.2 Analysis Engine
Objective: Develop an analysis engine capable of identifying key trends and patterns using various statistical or machine learning algorithms.

Approach:

Target Variable Identification:

The find_target_variable method leverages Google Gemini's generative model to determine the target variable based on the dataset's columns and a specific query.
Data Preprocessing:

The preprocess_data method encodes categorical variables using LabelEncoder and drops any remaining missing values to prepare the data for analysis.
Correlation Calculation:

The calculate_correlations method computes the correlation of all numerical features with the target variable, providing insight into their relationships.
Clustering:

The cluster_data method applies K-Means clustering to group similar data points. This helps in understanding the underlying structure of the data.
Visualization:

The plot_clustering, plot_correlation_heatmap, and plot_scatter methods generate various plots to visualize clustering results, correlation heatmaps, and scatter plots for feature-target analysis.




2.3 Report Generation
Objective: Create a module for generating comprehensive reports that include visualizations and summaries.

Approach:

HTML Report:

The generate_html_report method uses the dataprep library to create an HTML report summarizing the dataset and analysis results.
PDF Report:

The generate_pdf_report method, using the FPDF library, compiles the report into a PDF format. It includes sections for target variable analysis, data visualizations, and conclusions. Temporary files for images and plots are managed to ensure the final report is clean and accurate.
Visualization Integration:

The report includes plots such as clustering results, correlation heatmaps, and scatter plots, all generated using matplotlib and added to the PDF report.




2.4 User Interaction
Objective: Design a simple command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction and implement basic natural language processing to understand user queries.

Approach:

CLI Design:

The main execution loop prompts the user to enter questions. The answer_question method uses the Google Gemini model to provide responses based on the data analysis or clustering results.
Natural Language Processing:

The AI engine interprets user questions related to the analysis results and generates responses. If a target variable is identified, the engine uses the analysis to answer specific questions about correlations and trends.








3. Challenges Faced
Handling Diverse File Formats:

Supporting a wide range of file formats required integrating multiple libraries and writing custom code for less common formats.
Dynamic Column Management:

Dropping unnecessary columns dynamically was challenging. The initial static approach needed refinement to handle different datasets effectively.
Generating Insightful Analysis:

Interpreting correlations and clustering results in a meaningful way for the report required careful design of prompts and analysis.
User Interaction:

Implementing an intuitive CLI with natural language understanding involved ensuring that responses were relevant and useful based on the data analysis.







4. Potential Improvements
Enhanced Column Selection:

Develop a more dynamic approach for identifying unnecessary columns based on data content and metadata.
Advanced NLP Integration:

Improve natural language processing to handle more complex queries and provide more detailed responses.
Additional Statistical Methods:

Incorporate more advanced statistical and machine learning methods for analysis, such as feature importance or time series analysis.
User Interface:

Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction and visualization of data, which would complement the CLI and make the tool more accessible.
